                <small>SocialCare Chat</small>
                <p>The SocialCare Chat project will require various technical skills in order to successfully create and
                    launch. The team at XVI will be working hard over the next 6 weeks to begin with our beta product.
                    <br><br>

                    The SocialCare Chat application will be in the form of a web and mobile application that is
                    intuitive and user-friendly. Through both applications, we aim to have voice operated commands, a
                    navigational layout that is straight forward so our beloved elderly generation can jump on and
                    easily understand what to do next. We will need to use simple language and steer clear from jargon
                    and any form of millennial language, we would also like to consider implementing different languages
                    to suit all backgrounds. We will look to understand the phycology of colors and utilise such colors
                    that will resonate with the elderly generation and have a positive influence.
                    The SocialCare Chat will consist of many features, the most important feature is the chat option. We
                    want to give the elderly the opportunity to connect with their loved ones through conversation,
                    whether that be through text format or through the use of audio and video connection. The text
                    format will ideally have various language options, so those who may not understand the English
                    language as well as their own native language, can still connect with their loved ones through the
                    ease of their first language. Our beloved elderly will also be able to send and receive photos
                    through The SocialCare Chat.
                    <br><br>

                    Another feature of The SocialCare Chat are the games! It’s important to keep the brain as active as
                    possible and to exercise the muscle so, we will look to have a variety of the games that our elderly
                    generation may find interesting enough to get involved. We will look to include games such as chess
                    and checkers, and cards.
